# IdeaRoads

IdeaRoads is an open-source, self-hostable user feedback and feature voting platform. Teams use it to collect product feedback, let users vote on feature requests, track work on a public roadmap, and publish a changelog — all under their own domain.

Inspired by Canny and Fider. MIT licensed. No paid services or cloud vendor lock-in.

## Tech Stack

| Layer           | Choice                                    |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Framework       | Next.js 16 (App Router, TypeScript)       |
| UI              | daisyUI + Tailwind CSS v4, custom `ir-*` design tokens |
| Database        | PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM                  |
| Auth            | Better Auth — Magic Link + Google OAuth   |
| Background Jobs | pg-boss (same PostgreSQL DB, no Redis)    |
| Email           | Nodemailer + SMTP + React Email templates |
| Linting         | Biome (replaces ESLint + Prettier)        |
| Deployment      | Docker Compose                            |

## Quick Start

```bash
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env
pnpm db:local       # spin up embedded PostgreSQL (dev only)
pnpm db:migrate
pnpm dev            # starts Next.js + background worker concurrently
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` and sign in with a magic link.

### Two-host mode (Workspace vs Public Portal)

The Workspace/Admin app and the Public Portal can run as independent
applications with **isolated sessions** — signing into one never authenticates
the other. Set two hosts in `.env`:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_URL=http://app.localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_PORTAL_URL=http://portal.localhost:3000
```

Then use `http://app.localhost:3000` for the admin app and
`http://portal.localhost:3000` for a workspace's public portal
(`portal.localhost:3000/{slug}/roadmap`, etc.). Browsers resolve `*.localhost`
to loopback automatically; plain `http://localhost:3000` keeps working as a
single-origin full app. Leave both vars unset for single-origin mode. See
[`docs/migration/01-portal-subdomain-auth.md`](./docs/migration/01-portal-subdomain-auth.md).

To promote yourself to superadmin:

```bash
pnpm make:admin you@example.com
```

Without `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_USER`, and `SMTP_PASS` set, the worker logs emails to stdout instead of sending them.

### Configuration

`.env` only needs the handful of values required before the database is even
reachable (`DATABASE_URL`, `APP_SECRET`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`). Everything
optional — SMTP, Google OAuth, S3/R2 file storage, the inbound email webhook
secret — can instead be set from **Admin → Integrations** or the first-run
setup wizard, backed by the database, with secrets encrypted at rest. `.env`
still works for all of these as a fallback for existing installs. See
[`docs/implementation/INTEGRATIONS.md`](./docs/implementation/INTEGRATIONS.md)
for the full picture, including which settings need an app restart to take
effect.

## What's Implemented

### Authentication

- Magic link sign-in (no passwords)
- Google OAuth
- Secure cookie sessions with IP and User-Agent tracking
- Post-auth redirect: users go to their workspace (`/{slug}`), admins go to `/orbit`

### Account Settings (`/account/profile`)

- Edit name and email
- View and revoke active sessions
- Export account data as JSON
- Delete account

### Platform Admin (`/orbit/*`)

Superadmin-only panel — returns 404 for everyone else.

- **Overview** — user count, email queue size, job queue summary
- **Users** — table of all users with inline role promotion and ban/unban
- **Email** — outbox status (queued → sending → sent/failed) and inbound SMTP webhook events (bounces, deliveries, opens, clicks)
- **Queues** — pg-boss job states grouped by queue name

### Background Worker

Runs as a separate process alongside Next.js. Uses pg-boss (no Redis required).

| Job                    | Trigger                 | Description                                     |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `email.send`           | `enqueueEmail()` called | Process `email_outbox` row → Nodemailer SMTP    |
| `email.outbox-reap`    | Cron every 15 min       | Re-queue emails stuck in `queued` state         |
| `email.events-prune`   | Cron 3 AM daily         | Delete email events older than retention period |
| `scaffold.healthcheck` | Cron every 10 min       | System health check                             |

### Durable Email Outbox

Email is never sent inline. `enqueueEmail()` writes to `email_outbox` first, then enqueues the pg-boss job. If the app crashes between those two steps, the reap cron re-queues any stuck rows. Zero email loss.

### Audit Logging

Fire-and-forget audit trail on user creation, magic link send, logout, data export, and account deletion. Never blocks the primary action.
