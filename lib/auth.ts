  // requests: confirmed live via Chrome's own network stack, which reports
  // `blockedReasons: ["SameSiteLax"]` on the Set-Cookie response when signing

  // never persists a session — every subsequent authenticated action gets
  // "signed out" again and reopens the sign-in dialog.
  // SameSite=None (paired with Secure, which the spec requires and which
  // Better Auth already sets whenever the resolved protocol is https) is the
  // standard fix for auth that must work inside a third-party iframe — the
  // same approach embeddable widgets like Intercom/Crisp use. Restricted to
  // production only: `Secure` cookies are refused outright by browsers over
  // plain http://, so applying this in local dev would break sign-in
